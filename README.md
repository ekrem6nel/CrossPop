# CrossPop
Cross Platform Email Client

CrossPop is a cross-platform email management suite.
Inspired by TweetDeck this email client allows the user to filter emails into different columns.

Currently the project is at its inception phase and the technologies to be used are yet to be determined.
However, the developer's inclination is towards a C/C++ based solution based on open source tools and libraries.

Please get into contact for suggestions and improvements.

Thank you.
